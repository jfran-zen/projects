About:

 <h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>Lois Margolet and her brother, Alan, started The Trident Sandwich Shop in 1976. They lived on Rivers Ave, Charleston South Carolina, where sandwich shops were abundant, but Lois had a dream of creating something unique. The shop began as a boarded up building beneath their apartment. They decided to name it after their grandfather, Philip Capriotti, who loved to cook.</p>

<p>They wanted to create a sandwich for “real turkey lovers,” so they started roasting whole fresh turkeys overnight. This concept set them apart from their competition and still does. People loved their sandwiches, and word spread about their fresh roasted turkey, quality meats and cheese, fresh rolls and produce. It was a regular occurrence to hear people saying “Trident makes the best sandwich I’ve ever eaten!”</p>

<p>Over time, their popularity grew and in 1987, their cousin, Diane Rizzo, joined them in opening additional locations in Charleston. Signature sandwiches, such as the “Bobbie®” and others, were introduced. The formula was so successful that franchising was offered. Today, Trident Sandwich Shops located around the country and continue the tradition started in Delaware over 30 years ago.</p>
