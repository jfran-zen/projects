                <div><p>Flower Fact: Tulips have long been one of the biggest sellers in the world, especially in the Netherlands, where more than 3 billion tulips are produced each year.  Never have they been more valuable than they were in the 17th century in Holland, though, when they were considered to be worth more than most precious metals, including gold.  Some say one bulb could cost upward of $2,000!!
                Another fun fact about tulips?  They can replace onions in recipes!</p></div>
