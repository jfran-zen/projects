                <p>We’d love to hear from you! You can schedule a consultation via email, send us any questions you may have, or just browse our pictures on Instagram!</p>
                <p>How consultations work:
                We love to meet up with you and discuss your needs and ideas for your wedding or event. Ideally we will set up a casual conversion over a cup of coffee, but are open to phone consultations if needed. After the consultation, we will come up with a floral design package based on your requests and individual situation. If chosen, we will work with you from the initial design, to completing your vision, and all the way through your event! The ‘big day’ is where we really shine. 
                Please send us an email at flowersinkredding@gmail.com and we will return your inquiry as soon as we can! Feel free to ask about any other questions that might come up as well. </p>
                <div><p>Flower fact: Believe it or not, Broccoli is a flower! Are you shocked? You should! The Broccoli that you eat is a flowering head that is harvested before it fully grows. Have you thought that Broccoli is a vegetable?  It is not a vegetable but eaten as a vegetable! </p></div>
