                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <h2>Who We Are:</h2>
                <p>We are Ingrid and Kelly, owners and designers of FlowersINK. We met while working as educators with special education children. During that time we discovered a shared interest in all things flowers, and the rest is history.  
                Our first jobs were weddings for our daughters, and it was so much fun that a business was born.    
                You’ll find we are passionate about creating a floral experience that reflects you. We enjoy getting to know our clients and making their big day beautiful. As former educators we know the importance of listening so we get the look you want just right. It is important to us to connect with you and your love story.  
                A business that starts by hearing you, by becoming friends by making your wedding flowers unique to you and the story of your love.
                 </p>
